# Music-Player
Music can be played from the image which works like a buttom.
User can jump to the middle of song by click some point on the progress bar, it need a little bit accurate click.
The lyric will be highlighted by the pink, if the user choose to jump some where in the middle of song, the lyric may be highlighted to that when one sentence is finished(but will not jump to the highlighted place, user will need to manually scroll down).

All the songs in the file CANNOT use for any commerical purpose, they are just the sample of music player.
